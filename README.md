# OpenPinch
OpenPinch is a Python package for pinch analysis and total site integration studies. OpenPinch incorperates advanced methods, including multi-scale targeting, multiple utility targeting for isothermal and non-isothermal utility, assisted heat integration, grand composite curve manipulation, and more. Many of the concepts are also embedded in an Excel workbook through VBA macros--the original development. OpenPinch began as part of Tim Walmsley's PhD study at the University of Waikato. Over the subsquent years, OpenPinch has grown into the form it is today. 
OpenPinch can be installed into a Python Environment by running:
