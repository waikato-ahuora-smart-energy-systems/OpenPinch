# OpenPinch
OpenPinch is a Python package for pinch analysis and total site integration studies. OpenPinch incorperates advanced methods, including multi-scale targeting, multiple utility targeting for isothermal and non-isothermal utility, assisted heat integration, grand composite curve manipulation, and more. Many of the concepts are also embedded in an Excel workbook through VBA macros--the original development. OpenPinch began as as part of Tim Walmsley's PhD project and, over the subsquent years, grew into the form it is today.
