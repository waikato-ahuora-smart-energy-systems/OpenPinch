"""Typed configuration primitives and schemas for OpenPinch.

The :mod:`OpenPinch.lib` package exposes enumerations, configuration helpers,
and the Pydantic schema models that define the wire format used by the public
API.  They are re-exported here for consumers that need to construct or inspect
inputs programmatically.
