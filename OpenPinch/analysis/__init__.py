"""Analysis submodules implementing OpenPinch targeting algorithms.

This package re-exports the most commonly used entry points for preparing
problem structures, running Pinch Analysis at different aggregation levels, and
assembling response payloads.  More specialised helpers remain in their
respective modules (e.g. ``support_methods`` and ``additional_analysis``).
