Heat Exchanger Network Synthesis
================================

Install the HEN synthesis extra and the IDAES solver extensions before running
solver-backed methods:

.. code-block:: bash

   python -m pip install "openpinch[synthesis]"
   idaes get-extensions

Ranked Synthesis
----------------

.. code-block:: python

   from OpenPinch import PinchProblem

   problem = PinchProblem(
       "Four-stream-Yee-and-Grossmann-1990-1.json",
       project_name="Four Stream",
   )
   design = problem.design.heat_exchanger_network(
       approach_temperatures=[10.0, 14.0, 18.0],
       stages=[3],
       best_solutions=3,
   )

   top = design.top(3)
   network = design.network(rank=1)
   grid = design.grid(rank=1)

The design view also exposes ``selected_network``, total recovery, hot and cold
utility duty, and ``utility(name)``. Serialize the complete result with
``design.result.model_dump(mode="json")``.

Named Advanced Methods
----------------------

.. code-block:: python

   enhanced = problem.design.enhanced_heat_exchanger_network(quality_tier=2)
   open_hens = problem.design.open_hens()
   pinch_design = problem.design.pinch_design()
   thermal = problem.design.thermal_derivative(
       (pinch_design.selected_network,)
   )
   evolved = problem.design.network_evolution(
       (thermal.selected_network,)
   )

Successful synthesis stores the serializable result on
``problem.results.design`` (the ``TargetOutput.design`` field). The design view
provides the selected network, ranked candidates, manifest, diagnostics, and
task metadata without requiring process engineers to call contributor services.

For multiple operating periods, call
``problem.design.multiperiod_heat_exchanger_network(...)`` after explicit
all-period targeting.

Serialized Network Input
------------------------

The supported bridge carries the exact JSON-visible runtime dump through
``TargetInput.network``:

.. code-block:: python

   from OpenPinch.contracts.input import TargetInput

   network_payload = network.model_dump(mode="json")
   input_data = TargetInput.model_validate(
       {
           "streams": stream_payloads,
           "utilities": utility_payloads,
           "network": network_payload,
       }
   )

   restored = TargetInput.model_validate_json(input_data.model_dump_json())
   assert restored.model_dump(mode="json")["network"] == network_payload

The nested value is a transport schema, not a synthesis seed. Private solver
and source metadata are absent from the dump and rejected if manually added.
Endpoint classifications use title-case ``StreamID`` values: ``Process`` and
``Utility``. ``Unassigned`` and legacy lowercase values are invalid.

Segmented Variable-Heat-Capacity Streams
----------------------------------------

A variable-heat-capacity process stream remains one physical parent on the hot
or cold solver axis. Its ordered internal segments define the local
temperature--duty relation, heat-transfer coefficients, and exchanger area;
segment count does not inflate physical stream, match, exchanger, or stage
counts.

HEN preparation retains ordered segment temperatures, cumulative duties, local
heat-capacity flowrates, heat-transfer coefficients, and deterministic segment
identities. Stage balances advance a cumulative parent heat coordinate through
the piecewise ``T(Q)`` profile. Pinch decomposition can split the active profile
while preserving the one physical parent identity.

APOPT and Couenne use interval-disjunctive piecewise mappings. IPOPT uses
active-segment refinement and repeats the continuous solve until the selected
intervals stabilize. An unresolved active-segment solve is rejected with solver
guidance; OpenPinch does not silently substitute an average parent ``CP``.

Each selected parent-level exchanger can expose ordered
``segment_area_contributions``. A contribution records its period, hot and cold
segment identities, slice duty, local endpoint temperatures, local heat-transfer
coefficients, LMTD, and area. The multiperiod design area is the maximum
period-total slice area, not a sum of segment maxima taken from different
periods.

Area Objective and Reported Area
--------------------------------

The nonlinear topology and total-cost objective retains the smooth Chen area
surrogate. After solving, OpenPinch calculates reported exchanger area from
ordered duty-aligned slices with their local terminal temperatures and
heat-transfer coefficients. These segment-summed areas are used for result
verification, ranking, and derivative calculations. A future exact
logarithmic-LMTD formulation would be limited to the continuous NLP path and is
not the current contract.


Contributor verification separates ordinary, synthesis, and external-solver
profiles:

.. code-block:: bash

   pytest -m "not synthesis and not solver"
   pytest -m synthesis
   pytest -m solver
