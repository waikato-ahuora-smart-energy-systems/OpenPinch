Pre-Release Notes
=================

Unreleased
----------

Domain and input contracts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This pre-release changes the following contracts without compatibility shims:

- Values owned by ``Stream`` and ``StreamSegment`` are read-only. Mutations use
  explicit stream assignment, indexed-value, or segment-update APIs.
- Period weights use one validation policy: omitted trailing weights become
  ``1.0``; excess, non-finite, negative, and all-zero vectors are rejected.
- Structured process-stream and nested thermal-profile inputs reject unknown
  fields. Process streams accept the canonical ``name`` and
  ``heat_capacity_flowrate`` spellings only.
- Workspace bundles use schema version ``2`` and ``case_input``. Version ``1``,
  unknown versions, and the retired ``payload`` field are rejected.
- Segmented process streams and utilities share the same semantic validation in
  reports and preparation, including parent aggregate consistency.

Period-native PDM and utility constraints
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- PDM decompositions expose ordered ``period_targets`` with explicit period
  identities and indices. Clipped temperatures and active-stream flags are
  period-indexed; the retired singular target and clipped-temperature fields do
  not exist.
- Each operating period uses its own utility targets and pinch temperature.
  Shared topology is the union of streams and matches active in any period, and
  a pinch side is solved when any period requires it.
- Above- and below-pinch amalgamation retains every period's duties,
  temperatures, approach variables, split fractions, and explicit
  non-isothermal branch outlet temperatures.
- Non-isothermal warm starts normalize hot split fractions across cold matches
  and cold split fractions across hot matches independently in every period.
- Segmented utilities use local per-segment ``dt_cont`` values. The inlet uses
  the first segment contribution, the solved match outlet uses the traversed
  segment contribution, and an exact boundary uses the larger adjacent value.

Period-native HEN results
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- ``HeatExchanger`` retains shared topology, design area, and capital fields.
  Operational duty, activity, approaches, split fractions, and source/sink
  temperatures are stored in non-empty ordered ``period_states`` containing
  ``HeatExchangerPeriodState`` records.
- The retired exchanger-level operating scalar fields do not exist. Use
  ``exchanger.state(period_id)``; omission is accepted only for an exchanger
  with exactly one period state.
- Multiperiod duty, temperature, diagram, export, and controllability queries
  require ``period_id``. No implicit period-zero selection is provided.
- Extraction walks every period array, retains matches active only outside the
  first period, and prefers explicit non-isothermal branch outlet temperatures.
  Solved branch split fractions keep downstream duty checks physically valid.
